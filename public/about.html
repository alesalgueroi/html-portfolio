<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Alejandra, but everyone calls me Ale. I'm 25 years old,
  (almost 26) I'm a shy person when i'm around people i don't really know
  however, once i trust you, i wont stop talking. 
  I love to create and learn new things, i'm passionate about music, life,
  and whatever makes me feel alive. </p>

<p>I'm creative and i love writting, obviously i'm not a good writer, however i enjoy to
  put it paper what i thinkg about litterally, anything. I usually write about 
  daily toughts, my relationship,family, things i'm grateful for, etc.</p>

<p>And i almost forgot, but i am extramly sentimental person. So, that's a bit
  about me.</p>
